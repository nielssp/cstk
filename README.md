# CSTK

CSTK is the "[Classic Stylesheets](https://github.com/nielssp/classic-stylesheets) Toolkit". It's intended as both a simple and (hopefully) performant JSX-based frontend TypeScript library based on [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming), and a set of widgets, layouts and utilities for building traditional desktop GUIs for the web.

## Status

The reactive parts of CSTK have been renamed and moved to [Cytoplasmic](https://github.com/nielssp/cytoplasmic). The goal of this project is still to make a set of reactive widgets based on [Classic Stylesheets](https://github.com/nielssp/classic-stylesheets) for building traditional desktop GUIs for the web.
